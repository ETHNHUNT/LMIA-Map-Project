I'm working on a PowerBI dashboard featuring all companies that applied for and received Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) approval in Canada, available on lmiamaps.ca. 
The current data is messy, so I'm planning to clean it using Pandas and recreate the dashboard to make it cleaner and easier to use.
